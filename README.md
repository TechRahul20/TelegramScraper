# TelegramScraper
Telegram scraping tool for researching mis-/disinformation and investigating shady goings on.

Currently works only with "megagroups" for gathering member data, as opposed to individual channels.

Long-term, I aim to put together something that will gather members or forwards based on user selection, then export either as a graph file, or as raw data.
