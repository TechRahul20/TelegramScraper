# TelegramScraper
Telegram scraping tool for researching mis-/disinformation and investigating shady goings on.

megagroups: Gives the user an option to select a group they are part of and scrape member data.

forwards: Gives the user an option to select any chat they are part of and scrape message foward sources.

NOTE: 'forwards' only offers Channel ID or User ID, instead of Channel or User Name. Currently working on a fix for this.

Long-term, I aim to combine these to gather members or forwards based on user selection, then export either as a graph file, or as raw data.
